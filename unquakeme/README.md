# Unquake me

Unquake.me is a platform that allows a super-fast information gathering after the event of a catastrophe. 

Motivation
----------
A huge earthquake occurred in the province of Manabí in Ecuador, on April 16th of 2016. Our country was not prepared at all, and this could be seen in the lack of systems to gather real information in the disaster zones in order to act adequately and fast enough. Furthermore, some people trapped sent sms asking for their rescue, but it was difficult for the rescue teams to know where to act.
The first systems that failed were electricity and communications, we wanted to develop a system that would allow people in the disaster zone to gather information about their needs, like water, medicines or electricity, or systems that were still working in certain areas. Also, the system should be able to gather information about people trapped easily with just one click, specially their location, so when the rescue teams arrive the will already know where to perform rescue.

Details of the system
---------------------
The idea is to build SOS systems, supported on Raspberry Pi, routers and batteries systems located along the cities. Once the electricity and the communications go down given the disaster, the systems activate and begin to work. 
This allows us to use a Web Platform to which users can connect after the event and upload different types of indicators about the situation, such as: needs and active services, catastrophe level indicators, or even to ask for rescue with just one click.
The Raspberry Pi gathers all of the information and stores it. Once the rescue teams arrive, they can access the primary information stored on this servers, or once the communications are restored all the info is sent to the organism responsible for action and the rescue entities.

Why is this important?
----------------------
The system will allow to act faster, not only for the rescue teams that will know where to perform rescue tasks, but for the organisms in charge of decision making about where and how they should act first.

Prototype
---------
A working prototype was presented at the NASA Space Apps Challenge in Quito, Ecuador. We hope to develop completely the idea in the next weeks, including improvements of the user interface of the Web service.

NASA Space Apps Challenge
-------------------------
NASA is on a mission to foster innovation around challenges affecting us at home and in space. As one of the world's largest international annual hackathons, they designed Space Apps for problem solvers. 
Given Ecuador's catastrophe, two challenges regarding the event were proposed. One of those challenges was "Missing people", in which this project was presented.

Team
----
We are ecx-labs, a multi-disciplinary team, that performs ultra-fast innovation in order to develop and deploy technological and scientific solutions with high social and environmental impact.
